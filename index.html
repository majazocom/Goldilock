        <h3>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.</h3>
        <h3>At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry.</h3>
